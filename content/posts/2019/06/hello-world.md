After a quick look at [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), I decided to make my website with the technologies I already know.

Now you may ask yourself why I put "again" in the title and that is ok.

I already had a little blog and this is a rework. That's the reason.

What to expect?

-   Posts about web development
-   Posts about general topics
-   Maybe tutorials

So far,

Yannick Fricke
