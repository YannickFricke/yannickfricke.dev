My name is Yannick Fricke, I am 27 years old and live in the wonderful city called "Braunschweig" in Germany.

Here are some facts about me:

## How it all started

In my early days (around age 8) I was fascinated about computers and I thought: "One day I would like to know how to make applications".

Still interested I lend some IT books from our local library with the age of 12

For sure, with that age you don't know all the words, so you have to gain a bigger vocabulary.

At the age of 16 I bought my first own book for 50 â‚¬ (that was my pocket money for a whole month!).

Visual Basic .Net was my first choice, because I heard from a friend that it should be easy to learn.

But sadly I lost interest in it because I didn't understand arrays (now I laugh about that!).

Giving up? No way! After a short break I started to learn PHP. It was also at that time that I found a very nice mentor who helped me a lot and I'm very grateful for him.

I've been practicing PHP for several years and learned some other languages as well (which are listed below).
